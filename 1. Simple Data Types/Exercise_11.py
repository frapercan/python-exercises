# Imagine you have just opened a new savings account that offers you 4% interest per year. These savings due to interest,
# which are not collected until the end of the year, are added to your final savings account balance. Write a program
# that starts by reading the amount of money deposited in the savings account, entered by the user. Then the program
# should calculate and display the amount of savings after the first, second and third years. Round each amount to two
# decimal places.
