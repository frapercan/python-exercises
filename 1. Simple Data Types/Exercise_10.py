# A toy store is very successful in two of its products: clowns and dolls. They usually do mail order and the logistics
# company charges them by weight of each package so they have to calculate the weight of the clowns and dolls
# that will go out in each package on demand. Each clown weighs 112 g and each doll weighs 75 g. Write a program that
# reads the number of clowns and dolls sold in the last order and calculates the total weight of the package that will
# be shipped.
